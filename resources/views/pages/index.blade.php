            <font size="5"><b>M</b></font>anâ€™s quest for survival is intertwined with his necessity to conserve the environment in 
            which he lives. Effective and novel utilisation of energy along with the protection of 
            environment is widely discussed in the current academic scenario. T.K.M. College of Arts and 
            Science provide a platform for young minds to explore and investigate new vistas of the 
            effective management of energy and environment. The departments of Chemistry, Physics 
            and Mathematics of T.K.M. College of Arts and Science proudly hosts an <b>International 
            Conference on Energy and Environment</b>, focusing on the paradigms of conservation and 
            effective utilisation of energy and environment (iCEE 2K19), from December 12<sup>th</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup>, 
            2019. The aim of iCEE 2K19 is to provide a platform for researchers, faculties, engineers, 
            academicians, technologists, scientists, industrialists, environmentalists, and experts to 
            showcase their novel research in the field of Energy and Environment. The conference has 
            special thematic sections on the recent advances in interdisciplinary research on the 
            generation, storage, conversion and efficient utilization of energy. The conference also 
            highlights biomaterials and advanced nanomaterials on the control and prevention of 
            pollution.
